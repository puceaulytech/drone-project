Today we focused on finishing the drone that will be presented next week, for that purpose, we assembled the last pieces and i got to work on the code.
In the demonstration, we will show the two operating modes that i coded, those being the automated and manual. I still got some work to do in order for the
drone to be ready but everything is coming along nicely. 
The second drone that will serve as a test plateform is in design and wings are ready.
